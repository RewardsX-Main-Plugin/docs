# How it works
When a user sends messages in any of the tracked Discord channels, DiscordRewards increases their message counter.

Once the user’s total messages reach the configured message-threshold, the addon runs the configured reward-command through RewardsX for that player.

The reward can be anything RewardsX supports, such as items, money, or custom commands.
